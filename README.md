# Cerebot

Cerebot is a Discord chat bot that can relay queries to the IRC knowledge bots
for [DCSS](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/). See the
[command guide](docs/commands.md) for details on using Cerebot from
Discord. The remaining instructions on this page are only relevant if you want to
run a custom instance of this bot.

### Details

Cerebot can listen to one or more channels on an discord server for which it is
authorized, and can also respond to private channel queries. It supports
rate-limiting responses to excessive messages on the IRC connection. It
also supports basic vanity role modification commands.

Cerebot is single-threaded and uses
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html) to manage an
event loop with concurrent tasks.

### Installation

The following are required:

* Python 3.4 or later
* asyncio module (3.4.3 tested)
* irc module (13.1 tested)
* pytoml module (0.1.5 tested)
* discord module (0.16 tested)
* [beem](https://github.com/gammafunk/beem) module

All packages above except *beem* are available in PyPI. You can install
*beem* directly from its github repository using pip3. For example:

    pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/gammafunk/beem.git

`cerebot_config.toml` and edit the necessary fields based on how you'd like to run
the bot. The config file format is [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml),
